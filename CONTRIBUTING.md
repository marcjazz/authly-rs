# Contributing to Authkestra

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Authkestra! We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug reports and documentation improvements to new features and framework integrations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version recommended)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (for running integration tests with Redis/SQL)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/authkestra.git
    cd authkestra
    ```

2. Run the dependencies using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. Run the tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:

    ```bash
    cargo test --workspace
    ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature-branch
    ```

2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes, ensuring you follow the project's coding style and include documentation for any new public APIs.

3. **Run Lints and Formatting**:

    ```bash
    cargo fmt --all -- --check
    cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
    ```

4. **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass, including any new tests you've added.

    ```bash
    cargo test --workspace
    ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Push your branch to your fork and submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the main repository.

## Documentation

We use `cargo doc` to generate API documentation. Please ensure that all public APIs are documented with clear and concise doc comments. You can preview the documentation locally by running:

```bash
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --open
```
